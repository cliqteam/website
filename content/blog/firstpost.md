# Be a Dreamer

"Starting your own business is risky". This is the most common reaction you get when you tell someone you're starting your own business. In reality, the people giving you this feedback never took the risk to pursue what they dreamed of doing. 

Every child, teenager, and adult has a dream, don't let that dream die from the fear of others. Once I understood the importance of money and the value it holds, building a business and securing financial freedom was my goal regardless of the risk.

In my personal life, I dream of advernturing around the world, experiencing new cultures, and revoluationizing the global process of recylcing. Funny enough, that is one of my aspirations. The reason for starting this blog is to document the journey of starting my very first technology company Cliq.  I want to offer something that most wouldnt, the actual experiences people go through when starting a business. There will be posts from myself, and all the other founding members, each will be talking about experiences from our respective roles within this company, Code Development, Product Design, and Business Processes. 

This blog will be useful for anyone who also dreams of starting their business but might not know the rights things to do and when to do them. Looking forward to seeing successes from everyone who is involved in our journey!
