"Are you sure you want to start your own business? It's super risky". 

You hear this more often than not when you tell someone you're starting your own company, regardless of your reasons for starting said business. What it boils down to is, the people giving you this feedback never took the risk to pursue what they dreamed of doing.  Risks are neccessary to gain reward, you need to reflect on how much reward you strive for. 

In my personal life - I dream of adventuring around the world, experiencing new cultures, and revolutionizing the current effectiveness of recylcing. Funny enough, that is one of my aspirations. So how do I pursue these dreams I set for myself and make sure I have the financial security that let's me live the life I want to live? That's where this story is going.

The reason for starting this blog is to document the journey of a technology company called Cliq. Cliq was founded as a team effort to build solutions that will help the everyday consumer and businesses take advantage of the power of technology. My co-founders and I want to offer something that most wouldnt, real experiences we went through when starting this business. 

Cliq blog will contain posts from myself, and all the other founding members. Each person will be talking about experiences from their respective roles within this company - Code Development, Product Design, and Business Processes. We want to give our readers a holistic view so they can see how each leg of the company functions on it's own as well as with the whole. 

Our blog will be useful for anyone who also dreams of starting their business but might not know the right things to do and when to do them. Looking forward to meeting everyone involved in our journey!
